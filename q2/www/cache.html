  <h1> Cache Writeup </h1>
  <p><i><b>Browser Caches</b></i> are temporary files that your computer stores to allow faster load times when you visit the site again in the future. <br>
    Such examples of these asset files include images, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is necessary to clear our cache and cookies when testing if the <br>
    MailChimp form displays because the form will not appear again if we exit or complete the form.This happens because the first time we see the form,<br>
    our browser saves a cache of the form data (regardless if we filled it in or not). After reloading the page, the form will not reappear as we have <br>
    already provided our details or avoided the form altogether. By clearing the cache, we are seen as a <i>"new user"</i>, and thus, the form will be <br>
    displayed again.</p>
